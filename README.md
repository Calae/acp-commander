# ACP Commander

ACP Commander is a stock firmware control application for Buffalo NAS devices. It uses their proprietary protocol in order to run various actions such as resetting the root password, starting a telnet server and even direct shell commands, and is the basis for taking over and doing as you please with the stock firmware of your Buffalo device. This fork of the original ACP Commander project has the goal of adding reliable support for newer devices.
